"""
PyInstaller spec for ProtBot.

Build with:   pyinstaller packaging/protbot.spec --noconfirm
Run from the repository root, not from packaging/.

One-FOLDER, not one-file, deliberately:

  * One-file unpacks the whole app to %TEMP% on every launch, which is slow
    and is a behaviour antivirus heuristics score badly -- and this app already
    enumerates and closes processes, so it does not need more suspicion.
  * A folder build keeps every DLL a separate signable file. Signing a one-file
    stub leaves its payload unsigned.
  * Inno Setup wraps the folder into a single installer anyway, so the user
    still downloads exactly one file.
