licensing.py - Who is entitled to what.

Replaces the previous arrangement, which was not an arrangement at all:
`config.py` forced `plan = "premium"` on every install, every gate read that
value straight out of an editable JSON file, and `_activate_license` was a stub
that showed "coming soon". There was no path by which the product could take
money (AUDIT SF-08).

## What this can and cannot do

Be honest about the threat model. This is desktop software: the machine belongs
to the user, so a determined person can always patch the binary. Client-side
licensing is **deterrence, not security**, and pretending otherwise leads to
building elaborate schemes that cost real engineering and stop nobody.

So the design splits the problem:

  * The **server is the authority**. Anything that actually costs money to
    provide -- cross-device sync, hosted storage -- must be gated server-side
    at the point of use, where the client cannot argue with it.
  * The **client caches** the server's answer so the app works offline, and the
    cache is *tamper-evident* rather than tamper-proof: editing config.json by
    hand invalidates it and drops you back to free. That stops casual editing,
    which is the realistic case, and does not pretend to stop more.

## Offline behaviour

Failing closed the moment the network drops would punish paying customers for
being on a train. A verified entitlement therefore stays valid for
GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS after its last successful check, and only then degrades to
free. Re-verification is attempted well before that.
