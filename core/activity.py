"""
activity.py - Deciding whether elapsed time actually counts as usage.

The original accounting was pure wall-clock: the gap between two polls was
added to the session, unconditionally. Two consequences, both bad:

  * Shut the laptop lid overnight with Chrome open and ProtBot books eight
    hours of "usage", then closes Chrome the moment you resume.
  * An app sitting in a background window you never look at accrues time at the
    same rate as one you are actively working in.

The policy lives in counted_seconds(), which is a pure function so the rules
can be tested without Windows, a display, or a real clock. The two OS probes
below are thin and degrade to "cannot tell" everywhere else, in which case the
policy counts the time rather than silently under-reporting.
