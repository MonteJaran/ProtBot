"""
updates.py - Telling the user when a newer version exists.

Without this there is no way to reach someone who has already installed. Ship a
security fix and every existing install stays on the broken version forever.

Deliberately minimal. It fetches one small static JSON file and compares
versions; it does not download or install anything, because an app that can
silently replace its own executable is a far larger security surface than this
project can currently justify. The user is told, and clicks through to the
download themselves.

The manifest is a static file, so it can be hosted free on GitHub Pages,
Cloudflare Pages, or any static host. No backend required:

    {
      "version": "1.1.0",
      "url": "https://protbot.app/download",
      "notes": "Fixes a crash when...",
      "critical": false
    }

`critical` marks a security fix, so the UI can say so plainly rather than
looking like every other "an update is available" nag.
