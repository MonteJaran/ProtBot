"""
protected.py - Processes ProtBot must never track or terminate.

Without this list, a user can add any executable on disk as a tracked app and
give it a daily limit. Two things then go badly wrong:

  * Terminating a Windows critical process (csrss, wininit, winlogon, services,
    lsass, smss) triggers a CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED bugcheck. The app would blue
    screen the machine.
  * Terminating Task Manager on a 5-second loop locks the user out of the one
    tool they would use to stop ProtBot. That behaviour is also what
    antivirus heuristics score as a trojan.

The list is matched on executable name, lowercased. That is the right
granularity: calc.exe and mspaint.exe also live in System32 and are perfectly
reasonable things to limit, so a blanket "everything in System32" rule would be
wrong.
