generate_icon.py - Regenerate ProtBot.ico.

Development tool, not shipped and not a runtime dependency: it needs Pillow,
which the app itself no longer uses. Run it only when the icon design changes.

    python -m pip install Pillow
    python generate_icon.py

Writes every size Windows actually asks for. The previous icon contained a
single 16x16 image, so Windows upscaled it everywhere else — the taskbar, the
Alt-Tab switcher, the desktop shortcut, the installer and Explorer's large-icon
view were all a blurry 16x16 stretched to 48 or 256 pixels. That is worse now
that the app is DPI-aware, because the OS no longer hides it behind its own
bitmap scaling.
