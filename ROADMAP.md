# ProtBot Roadmap

Where planned features live so they are not forgotten — and so they stay **out**
of the marketing surface until they actually work.

## The rule

A feature may only appear in `_FREE_FEATURES` or `_PREMIUM_FEATURES`
(`ui/devices_page.py`) once it works end to end in the shipped build.

Everything else goes in `_PLANNED_FEATURES`, which renders greyed out under a
"Planned" heading with a "not included in any purchase" note. Selling a feature
that does not exist is deceptive advertising, and becomes a refund and
chargeback problem the moment the app takes money.

When a feature ships, move it up the list here **and** in `devices_page.py`.

## Planned Premium features

These are the features that were previously advertised as if they existed. They
are the intended Premium tier — kept here in full so the plan survives.

### 1. Cross-device sync
Usage totals aggregated across every linked device, so a daily limit applies to
you rather than to one machine.

- **Status:** client-side plumbing exists (`ui/devices_page.py`,
  `ui/processes_page.py`, `server/models.py`), server is unversioned
- **Blocked on:** committing the backend to this repo (AUDIT ST-05) and adding
  API authentication (AUDIT SF-09)
- **Notes:** device registration, 8-char link codes and the 30-minute upload
  protocol are already designed and partly built

### 2. Configurable data retention — SHIPPED

- **Status:** done. `retention_days` defaults to 365; 0 keeps everything.
  Pruning runs on the daily date rollover the monitor already detects, not at
  startup, so launch stays fast.
- **Note:** this is now a plain user setting rather than a paid tier. Making
  someone pay to keep their own history is a poor trade, and the database
  indices (SF-11) solved the performance half of the problem anyway.

### 3. Pattern recognition across your history
Surface real patterns from recorded usage: which app tends to precede a long
distraction session, which days drift worst, how a week compares to the last.

- **Status:** not started
- **Blocked on:** retention (needs enough history to be meaningful)
- **Notes:** was advertised as "AI pattern recognition". Start with plain
  statistics over the existing `usage_sessions` table — week-over-week deltas,
  correlation between app launches, time-of-day clustering. That is genuinely
  useful and needs no model. Only call it AI if a model is actually involved


### 4. Predictive distraction alerts
Warn *before* a distraction session starts, based on time of day and what was
just opened.

- **Status:** not started
- **Blocked on:** #3
- **Notes:** the honest v1 is a threshold rule ("you have opened this app at
  this hour on 4 of the last 5 days"), not a prediction model

### 5. PDF / Excel report export
Formatted weekly and monthly reports.

- **Status:** not started — CSV export exists
  (`ui/processes_page.py:export_csv`) and works
- **Blocked on:** nothing
- **Notes:** adds dependencies (`reportlab` or `weasyprint`, `openpyxl`) —
  check their licences against the packaging decision in AUDIT BL-05 first

### 6. Team challenges & leaderboards
Shared goals across a group of linked users.

- **Status:** not started
- **Blocked on:** #1, and a real user account model — device IDs are not
  identities
- **Notes:** biggest scope of anything here, and the largest privacy surface.
  Needs its own consent step beyond the first-run gate, since it publishes one
  person's usage to others

### 7. Scheduled focus hours — SHIPPED

- **Status:** done. `core/schedule.py` plus a Settings section. One recurring
  window (days, start, end, cap) rather than a multi-block scheduler — that
  covers work hours, study hours and evenings, and it ships complete.
- **Semantics:** only affects apps that already have a daily limit, and can
  only ever tighten, never loosen. A cap of 0 blocks outright.
- **Note:** overnight windows (22:00–06:00) work, and the window belongs to the
  day it started on, so a Friday-night block still applies at 01:00 Saturday.
  That is the case a naive `start <= now <= end` gets wrong.
- **Next:** multiple named blocks, if anyone asks for them. One window first.

### 8. Priority support
A commitment, not a feature.

- **Notes:** only advertise once there is a support channel and a response
  target you can actually meet

---

## Before any of this ships

Premium cannot be sold at all until the monetization chain works. From
`AUDIT.md`:

- **SF-08** — mostly done. `core/licensing.py` holds the entitlement gate,
  signed and machine-bound, with a 14-day offline grace period; activation is a
  real flow. What remains is a `/license/verify` endpoint on the server and a
  merchant of record to sell keys
- **SF-09** — *partial*. The client now sends a per-device token as
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every sync call instead of relying on the
  device id alone. What remains is a server that actually checks it
- **ST-05** — the backend is not in version control

Sequence: finish SF-08 and SF-09's server half, commit the server, integrate a
merchant of record, *then* build features 1–7.

## Under discussion

Not scoped, not designed, and not started — recorded here only so the idea
survives until it is.

### Parent-controlled profiles
A parent's phone or PC would hold a "parent" profile that sets what a linked
"kid" profile is allowed: which apps, what limits, what schedule — configured
remotely rather than on the monitored device itself.

- **This is a different product, not a bigger feature.** Everything sync does
  today is *usage totals flowing up* to be aggregated — it has no path for
  *settings flowing down* to change what another device enforces, and no
  concept of one profile having authority over another's configuration at
  all. Building that is closer in size to cross-device sync itself than to
  any single item above it.
- **It also collides with `PRIVACY.md` as written**, which currently says
  ProtBot "is not intended for children under 16" and puts the burden of
  legality for monitoring another person on the person doing the installing.
  A parent-controls-child mode needs its own consent story (a parent
  consenting on a minor's behalf is not the same legal act as self-monitoring
  consent), its own data-handling section, and likely its own regulatory
  reading — COPPA in the US, the GDPR's Article 8 child's-consent age, the
  EU's rules for services aimed at minors. None of that is a code change.
  Whether ProtBot takes that on at all is the owner's call, made once,
  because the licence file already calls it "software you intend to sell"
  and that decision compounds.
- **The device also stops being able to trust its own user.** Today's threat
  model is explicit: the machine belongs to whoever runs it, so client-side
  enforcement is deterrence, not security (`core/licensing.py`'s own words).
  A kid profile needs the opposite property — resistant to being turned off
  *by the person sitting at it* — which is a materially harder problem the
  app has never had to solve.

## Deliberately not doing

- **Ads.** The ad slot exists in `ui/app.py` but `_ADS` is empty and stays that
  way until a real ad network is integrated. Never fill it with real companies'
  names or taglines as placeholder content — that is false endorsement
